	<h3>Rules of the Game</h3>
	<p>
	<b>Here are some very important guidelines and rules</b><br>

	<p>
	The game is pretty similar to last time. You get a target, and someone is targeting you.
	When you kill your target, you get your victim's target. The game continues until there
	are two people left. The final challenge will be played at night during the first day 
	back before tri III.<br><br>
	Now, there are a few changes to elongate the game and promote deception tactics. 
	You kill someone by tapping them on the shoulder (or other inoffensive body part) and
	saying something along the lines of "you have been assassinated." They then need to sign
	in to the website and press their own kill switch. <b>DO NOT</b> press your own kill
	switch unless you are killed. Kills are only valid if you are out of eyeshot
	<b> and earshot</b> of anyone else (including non-combatants) and have been so for at
	least <b>5 seconds</b>. Judgement calls can come to the spymaster (Jonathan Stepp) for
	a ruling.<br><br>
	One other new(ish) rule. If you are caught playing the game after in-room by a (non-JJ)
	SLI, then you are honor-bound to press your kill switch. I don't want this game to 
	affect people's sleep habits too much.<br><br>
	Also, as before, <b>your own</b> room is a safe space. You cannot be killed there
	(even if your roommate is trying to kill you).<br><br>

	Now, I will quickly go over a few terms used in the game so people aren't confused.<br><br>

	Score: How many people you have killed<br><br>
	Influence: A rough estimate of how influential you are. This is based on both
	who you kill and how many people they killed before you killed them.<br><br>
	Operation: Your mission to kill people. Your operation name is your password.
	Remember it, please<br><br>
	Finally, if you have any questions, or lose your login, ask me.<br><br>
	Happy Hunting!
